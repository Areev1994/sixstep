## PRIMARY SOURCE: Phase 1 Part 2 (Solution Design)

**✅ START HERE**: `active/{problem_id}/guide/step3_brainstorm.md` - **Part 2: Solution Design**

**What this provides:**
- Complete solution strategy with full rationale
- Key design decisions with implementation considerations
- Components involved with their roles and required changes
- Complete trade-off analysis showing why approach was chosen
- This is your PRIMARY source - tasks implement this design

**Why Part 2 is primary:**
- Phase 1 Part 2 contains validated solution design approved by user
- Design decisions map directly to implementation tasks
- Components, decisions, and trade-offs define WHAT to build
- Tasks translate design into HOW to build it

## CONTEXT SOURCE: Phase 1 Part 1 (Investigation Findings)

**Same file** - `active/{problem_id}/guide/step3_brainstorm.md` - **Part 1: Investigation Findings**

**What this provides:**
- Understanding of how current system works (background context)
- Why the problem occurs (motivation for solution)
- Constraints discovered during investigation

**Why Part 1 matters:**
- Provides background context for design decisions
- Explains constraints that shaped solution approach
- Not direct task source, but informs understanding

## PREVIOUS STEPS CONTEXT

**Read guide files for complete context:**
- `active/{problem_id}/guide/step1_questions.md` - Full Step 1 context with reasoning, architectural diagrams
- `active/{problem_id}/guide/step2_assessment.md` - Complete Step 2 research and analysis with all evidence

**Why previous steps matter:**
- Step 1 shows problem context and investigation approach
- Step 2 provides factual research that informed investigation
- Complete picture helps understand design rationale

## USER-REVIEW vs GUIDE

**📋 User-review files** (`active/{problem_id}/user-review/`) **are glanceable summaries:**
- Quick overview of investigation findings and solution design
- Good for quick reference but not sufficient for task creation
- Lacks complete rationale and implementation details

**✅ Guide files** (`active/{problem_id}/guide/`) **have complete details:**
- Full design rationale, all trade-offs analyzed, all components documented
- Complete implementation considerations for each design decision
- This is what you need for accurate task derivation

**Why guide over user-review for task creation:**
- Tasks need complete implementation details, not summaries
- Guide version has specific component changes, considerations, dependencies
- Missing details = incomplete task list
