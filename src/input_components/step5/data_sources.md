## PRIMARY SOURCE: Step 4 Implementation

**✅ START HERE**: `active/{problem_id}/guide/step4_implement.md` - Complete implementation details

**What this provides:**
- Full implementation log with all tasks completed
- Architectural analysis and pattern matching decisions
- Implementation challenges and resolutions
- Code rationale and design decisions
- Build validation results

**Why primary:**
- Need complete context to understand what was implemented and how
- Architectural decisions inform what needs testing
- Implementation challenges reveal areas needing extra validation
- Build results show compilation status

**User-review version**: `active/{problem_id}/user-review/step4_implement.md`
- What: Implementation summary with task completion status and files modified
- Why: Quick reference for what changed without reading full implementation log

## CONTEXT SOURCES: Previous Steps (Guide + User-Review)

**Step 1 - Problem Understanding:**
- **Guide**: `active/{problem_id}/guide/step1_questions.md`
  - What: Complete problem context with reasoning, Category 2 questions, Category 3 approach, architectural diagrams
  - Why: Original problem requirements are validation criteria; must verify solution solves original problem

- **User-review**: `active/{problem_id}/user-review/step1_questions.md`
  - What: Problem summary with key questions
  - Why: Quick reference for problem statement

**Step 2 - Current State Assessment:**
- **Guide**: `active/{problem_id}/guide/step2_assessment.md`
  - What: Complete factual research with evidence and source documentation
  - Why: Baseline understanding of system before implementation; helps identify what changed

- **User-review**: `active/{problem_id}/user-review/step2_assessment.md`
  - What: Assessment summary with answer status
  - Why: Quick reference for system state facts

**Step 3 - Solution Design:**
- **Guide**: `active/{problem_id}/guide/step3_brainstorm.md`
  - What: Investigation findings, solution design with full rationale, task breakdown
  - Why: Solution approach and expected behavior inform test design; understand what solution should do

- **User-review**: `active/{problem_id}/user-review/step3_brainstorm.md`
  - What: Solution summary with key design decisions
  - Why: Quick reference for solution approach

**Why guide vs user-review:**
- Guide files contain complete reasoning, evidence, and context for Claude's analysis
- User-review files are glanceable summaries for quick reference checks
- Both needed: Guide for comprehensive understanding, user-review for rapid lookup

## PROJECT MEMORY SOURCES (TESTING SKILLS)

**Skills Layer (Testing Methodologies):**
- `project_memory/skills/*.md` - Reusable testing and validation techniques
- Testing methodologies (test case design, validation procedures)
- Performance benchmarking techniques
- Systematic validation workflows
- Each skill includes: what it is, when to use, step-by-step procedure, examples, common pitfalls

**Why skills for Step 5:**
- Skills layer captures proven testing techniques learned in past sessions
- Validation procedures can be reused across different problems
- Systematic approaches ensure thorough testing

**When to use skills:**
- Need methodology for designing test cases
- Want systematic validation approach
- Looking for proven testing techniques

## CURRENT STEP OUTPUTS

**Created during Step 5:**
- `active/{problem_id}/guide/step5_testing.md` - Complete test documentation with methodology, results, issues, resolutions
- `active/{problem_id}/user-review/step5_testing.md` - Test status summary with pass/fail overview

**Why these outputs:**
- Guide version documents complete validation process for future reference
- User-review version provides quick test status for user glancing
